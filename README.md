# climate-change-clint

Note at a later date: 
Made for a school project. No AI is involved here, Clint just draws his responses from a very large text file.
All art and writing done by me!

Original text:
Climate Change Clint is a chatbot written in Racket, designed to talk to you and give you tips about climate change.
